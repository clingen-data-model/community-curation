<p>Dear {{$recipient->name}},</p>

<p>Thank you for completing your initial training as a ClinGen community volunteer.</>

<p>In order to progress to curation, we require you to attest to your training.</p>

<p>
    Please login into the 
    <a href="{{url('/')}}">ClinGen Community Curation Database</a>, 
    and complete the attestation by selecting the “Sign Attestation” button.
</p> 

<p>
    Of note, for those volunteers that have chosen to participate in more than one curation activity, 
    an attestation is required for each curation activity.
</p> 

<p>
    If you have any questions, concerns, or difficulties in completing this step, please contact us at 
    <a href="mailto:volunteer@clinicalgenome.org">volunteer@clinicalgenome.org</a>.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The ClinGen Community Curation Working Group</p>
