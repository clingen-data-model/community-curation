<p>Good morning,</p>
 
<p>
    ClinGen's Community Curation Working Group would like to thank you for your contributions to our curation effort! 
    To make the process of training and integrating new volunteers into our working groups and expert panels go as smoothly as possible, we would like to hear your feedback. 
    Please take this <a href="{{url('/volunteer-3-month-followup')}}">anonymous survey</a>, it should only take ~10-15 minutes. 
    Please try to complete this by {{\Carbon\Carbon::today()->addDays(21)->format('l, F jS')}}, but the survey will still be available after that date.
</p>

<p>
    If you have any questions or concerns please contact <a href="mailto:volunteer@clinicalgenome.org">volunteer@clinicalgenome.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,
    <br>
    The ClinGen Community Curation Working Group
</p>
