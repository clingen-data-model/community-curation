<p>Good afternoon,</p>
 
<p>
    Thank you to those who have already taken the Volunteer Survey and given their feedback! 
    All of your input will be helpful in improving our volunteer process and the overall volunteer experience with ClinGen. 
    If you have not yet taken the <a href="{{url('/volunteer-three-month')}}">survey</a> 
    we ask that you do by {{\Carbon\Carbon::today()->addDays(14)->format('l, F jS')}}.  
    We look forward to hearing all about your experience with the ClinGen volunteer process.
</p>
 
<p>
    Feel free to contact <a href="mailto:volunteer@clinicalgenome.org">volunteer@clinicalgenome.org</a> with any questions
</p>

<p>
    Thanks, 
    <br>
    The ClinGen Community Curation Working Group
