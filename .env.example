# to give an idea of what config values you might want to change, and it
# is read by laravel when it starts up. You can also set these values
# in the environment to override these values (e.g., when running in
# kubernetes)

# This file is also used by the docker-compose.yml file to set some
# environment variables for development.

# (.env is not in the repository because it contains secrets)
